## Guide to generate articles and corresponding XML files
* Clone the repository into the local system.

* For generating an article, one need the data, render.py, template and genXML.py. Make sure that these files are available.

* Running the genXML.py initialises all the functions necessary for XML generation

* Both the article and the XML file can then be generated by running the main.py file

## Data
* Indian cars.csv-This is the final dataset which contains the attributes of Indian Cars.
*•	Cars_report.html-This data analysis report is used to check how many unique values are present for every attribute and how many missing values for the attributes.

## Templates

 Github folder link:

* Cars.indian.j2-This template contains the information about Infobox, Introduction, Engine and Performance, Design for Indian Cars.

### Generating XML dump

* Follow the comments of 'render.py' and uncomment necessary lines to generate XML dump.
* Execute 'render.py'  file with the  following command:
- `python3.7 render.py`. 
- We can generate as many number of articles by slicing the ids list.
